What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n","  - OOP is a way of organizing code like a set of tools (called objects) that can interact with each other. These tools can hold data and do tasks. It's like a recipe book where each recipe has ingredients and instructions.\n","\n","#2. What is a class in OOP?\n","  - A class is like a blueprint for making objects. Imagine a blueprint for a house — it shows you how to build it but isn't a house itself. In code, a class shows you how to create objects (like creating a car, dog, or computer).\n","\n","#3. What is an object in OOP?\n","  - An object is an actual thing created using a class. If a class is a blueprint, then an object is the real thing, like a specific car, dog, or computer built from that blueprint.\n","\n","#4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n","  - Abstraction: It means hiding unnecessary details. For example, you don't need to know how a car's engine works to drive it — you just need to know how to use the steering wheel and pedals.\n","  - Encapsulation: It means wrapping up data and the functions that operate on it into one neat package. For example, a car's engine and control system are hidden away inside the car — you can't easily see them, but you can interact with the car as a whole.\n","\n","#5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n","  - Dunder methods (short for double underscore) are special functions in Python that help us do things like add objects together or convert them to strings. For example, when you add two numbers, Python uses __add__.\n","\n","#6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n","  - Inheritance is when a class gets features from another class. Imagine you inherit traits from your parents, like eye color. A class (like a \"Dog\") can inherit from another class (like \"Animal\") and get its traits, but also add its own traits.\n","\n","#7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n","  - Polymorphism means that different objects can do the same thing, but in their own way. For example, both a dog and a cat can \"speak,\" but they do it differently (a dog barks, a cat meows).\n","\n","#8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n","  - In Python, we hide certain details inside an object, making them private (like keeping important things locked away in a safe). This helps protect data from being changed without permission.\n","\n","#9. What is a constructor in Python?\n","  - A constructor is a special function that runs when an object is created. It sets up the initial state of the object. It's like when you buy a new car and the car starts ready for you to drive.\n","\n","#10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n","  - A class method works with the class itself, not individual objects. It's like telling the car company to recall all cars, not just one car.\n","  - A static method doesn't use the class or the object. It's like giving general advice that doesn't depend on the car you own.\n","\n","#11. What is method overloading in Python?\n","  - Method overloading means you can have the same method name with different kinds of input. It's like a \"calculator\" that can add, subtract, or multiply depending on what you give it. Python doesn't directly support overloading, but you can get around that with different types of input.\n","\n","#12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n","  - Method overriding means that a child class can change how it behaves compared to the parent class. If the parent class has a \"drive\" method, the child class can change it to add a new behavior.\n","\n","#13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n","  - A property decorator makes a method look like an attribute (a variable). It's like making a special function behave like a simple variable, so you can use it like car.color instead of calling it as a function car.get_color().\n","\n","#14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n","  - Polymorphism is important because it lets us use the same function or method across many different objects, and each object will do it in its own way. It keeps the code flexible and easy to work with.\n","\n","#15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n","  - An abstract class is like a blueprint that you can't use directly. It just tells you what methods you should have, but it doesn't implement them. Other classes that inherit from it must complete the details.\n","\n","#16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n","  - Modularity: It organizes code into smaller parts that are easier to manage.\n","  - Reusability: You can reuse parts of your code in different projects.\n","  - Maintainability: You can fix bugs or update one part without affecting the whole program.\n","  - Scalability: It makes it easy to add new features without breaking everything.\n","\n","#17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n","  - Class variables: They are shared by all objects created from a class. It's like a group of people all sharing a common item.\n","  - Instance variables: They are unique to each object. It's like each person having their own personal item.\n","\n","#18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","  - Multiple inheritance means a class can inherit from more than one class. It's like a child getting traits from both parents and grandparents.\n","\n","#19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n","  - __str__ : It is for making an object look nice when you print it. It's like saying, \"How should we describe this object to the user?\"\n","  - __repr__: It is for giving a detailed description of an object. It's like saying, \"If someone wants to recreate this object, here's how they would do it.\"\n","\n","#20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n","  - super() allows you to call methods from the parent class. It's like asking your parent to help you do something that they know how to do.\n","\n","#21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","  - The __del__ method is called when an object is destroyed. It helps clean up things, like closing a door when you leave a room.\n","\n","#22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n","  - @staticmethod: It doesn't care about the class or the object. It's just a regular function.\n","  - @classmethod: It knows about the class itself and can work with class-level variables.\n","\n","#23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","  - Polymorphism lets different objects from different classes use the same method name, but each one can do it differently. It's like the same \"talk\" command, but one object talks in one way and another talks differently.\n","\n","#24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","  - Method chaining is calling multiple methods one after the other, like a quick conversation where each method is talking to the next.\n","\n","#25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n","  - The __call__ method lets an object be used like a function. So, instead of calling a method like obj.method(), you can call the object directly like obj()."],"metadata":{"id":"nYxc6Pdn8VUM"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#1.
